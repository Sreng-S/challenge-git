# Git Challenge

There are two branches, `add-echo` and `add-reverse`. The goal of this challenge is to use `git rebase` to bring both commits onto master. When finished there should be no merge commits or branching. For example, `git log` on the `master` branch should look similar to this:

```
/challenge-git master
âš¡ git log
